            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In recent years, AI has evolved exponentially where they're able to perform tasks similar to what humans do. This technology can do many things such as walking a dog, delivering food, or performing tasks in factories. AI are essentially limitless on what they can do, but the one thing limiting them is knowledge. AI has a "library of knowledge" where they can only perform certain tasks based on what information is stored in their memory.</p>
            <p>Some would say that AI is taking over people's job and eventually the world, and some would claim that AI is a huge step forward in revolutionizing technology. People are concerned for losing their jobs because of AI technologies performing tasks better than they can. However, some would claim that AI is a huge step forward in revolutionizing technology. Having AI brings huge opportunities on how technology can be pushed forward. Think of it as a story game, where you can pick which option to choose to perform certain outcomes. .</p>
